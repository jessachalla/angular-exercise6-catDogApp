ANGULAR EXERCISE 6
Skills: Components, routing
Create an AngularJS app with two components: dog and cat. The dog component shows an image of a dog and the word “dog”, or the name of your favorite dog. The cat component does the same for a cat. Set up routing so #!/dog displays the dog component and #!/cat displays the cat component. Display links between the two routes. Set up one of the two as the default route when a user first arrives at the site.
